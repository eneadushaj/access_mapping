# access_mapping
This package allows for object recognition and localization within a 3D space. The intended application includes creating maps for autonomous vehicles or disabled persons in order to determine available routes for navigation based on accessibility constraints (ie. Wheelchair users require access into buildings through doors with ADA access button that control automatic doors. This package includes a ROS node which can detect ADA access buttons, and place them on a map to allow mapping through automatic doors for wheelchair users). This program takes in an rgb image, depth image, camera info, and outputs Points in 3D space, as well as an occupancy grid detailing where certain detected objects are on a 2D plane.
